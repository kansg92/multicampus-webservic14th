A painter who declared an "assassination of painting," an absolute denial of the established aesthetics celebrated among the bourgeoisie of the 1930s ¡ª that was who Joan Miro (1893-1983) was.

Miro's dislike of bourgeois art was manifested in his lifelong attempts to plunge into spontaneous experimentation without limits, which came to hold strong influence and paved new roads of possibilities for later generations of pioneering creators.

While he brushed shoulders with cohorts of artists who forged the styles of Dada and surrealism, especially during his early years, it is difficult to identify him precisely within any particular artistic movement, as he dedicated his life to liberating himself from conventions and developing his own creative language.

His expressive use of colors with lively pictorial motifs gave birth to an intriguing constellation of women, birds, stars, suns, moons and ladders that float freely in a vast field of imagination.

"Joan Miro: Women, Birds, Stars" at My Art Museum in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, takes a dive into the quintessential Spanish modernist's hyper-visual ensemble of inventiveness and playful curiosity.

The exhibition brings together more than 70 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and tapestries produced from the later 40 years of his career ¡ª all from the collection of Fundacio Joan Miro, a museum established by the artist himself in 1975 in his hometown of Barcelona.

Viewers are invited to immerse themselves in Miro's series of intense colorful forms, infinitesimal dots and free-willed scribbles inside the gallery. While all these elements are born from the artist's improvised strokes, they do not exist in a haphazard, chaotic manner. Rather, his visual vocabulary manages to achieve a poetic equilibrium between the familiar and the unknown.</p>
